## Sanger sequencing

To sequence a DNA, add mixture of normal nucleotides and low concentration of ddNTPs. The ddNTPs are fluorescently labeled: each type of ddNTP with a different color.

## Next generation sequencing/deep sequencing
workflow: alignment, variant calling, postprocessing (filtering/QC)

## NGS Applications
### Genomics
Whole genome sequencing

Whole exome sequencing and targeted sequencing

## Main Applications of NGS in Genetics
Discover rare variants of Mendelian Diseases

Rare variants in common complex diseases, often in case-control settings
