    "an interdisciplinary field that develops and applies computer and computational technologies to study biomedical questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "a powerful technology to manage, query and analyze big data in life sciences, a top-down systems approach that generates new hypotheses, finds new patterns, and discovers new functional elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "studies questions in biology and medicine, develops and applies methods in computer sciences, mathematics, statistics and physics, and overlaps with medical/clinical informatics, systems biology and synthetic biology.\n",

    "## CNV notes\n",
    "### Structural variation (SV)\n",
    "Structural variation (also genomic structural variation) is the variation in structure of an organism's chromosome. It consists of many kinds of variation in the genome of one species, and usually includes microscopic and submicroscopic types, such as deletions, duplications, copy-number variants, insertions, inversions and translocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_variation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### copy number variation\n",
    "Copy number variation (CNVs) is a relatively new field in genomics and it is defined as a phenomenon in which sections of the genome are repeated and the number of repeats in the genome varies between individuals in the human population.\n",
    "CNVs > 20kb are studied more extensively because they are easier to detect. Most common source of CNVs is NAHR (Non-allelic homologous recombination).\n",
    "\n",
    "[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-number_variation)\n",
    "\n",
    "CNPs are Defined as CNV with frequency > 1% in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### De novo mutation\n",
    "an alteration in a gene that is present for the first time in one family member as a result of a mutation in a germ cell (egg or sperm) of one of the parents or in the fertilized egg itself.\n",

    "Haploinsufficiency is the phenomenon where a diploid organism has only a single functional copy of a gene (with the other copy inactivated by mutation) and the single functional copy of the gene does not produce enough gene product (typically a protein) to bring about a wild-type condition, leading to an abnormal or diseased state."
