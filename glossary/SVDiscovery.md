## SV
Structural variation was originally defined as insertions, deletions and inversions greater than 1 kb in size.

SV discovery and genotyping requires accurate prediction of three features: copy, content and structure.

## methods for discovery and then for genotyping
Microarrays have been the experimental workhorse of CNV discovery and genotyping.

These are represented primarily by array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) and SNP microarrays.

## Hybridization-based microarray approaches
### Array CGH
Array CGH platforms are based on the principle of comparative hybridization of two labeled samples (test and reference) to a set of hybridization targets.

### SNP arrays
a key advantage of SNP microarrays is the use of SNP allele-specific probes to increase CNV sensitivity

SNP arrays have proved popular in CNV-detection studies
