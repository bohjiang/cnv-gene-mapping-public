motivations
possible questions
type 1 error


several question
case control count
CNV test
case cnv burden
per ind cnv rate
size, number of genes

gene site
if cnv gene site?: enrichment
gene site: annotation, cnv overlap gene site in cases and controls

data set plan
learn parameter, odds ratio, frequency, effect size, 
familiar with data set


dataset
1. Convergence of genes and cellular pathways dysregulated in autism spectrum disorders [Pinto & Scherer, AJHG, 2014]
2. Novel Findings from CNVs Implicate Inhibitory and Excitatory Signaling Complexes in Schizophrenia, [Pocklingtong, Neuron, 2015]	// methodology paper
3. Copy number variation in schizophrenia in Sweden [Szatkiewicz, Mol Psychiatry, 2014]

plan, refer to figures in 2014 Pinto paper
cnv, understand data
e.g. Pinto 2010
first, cnv burden analysis, deletion and duplication separately, cnv size distribution, cnv del and dup distribution, summary dist
2nd. case and control comparison
3rd. gene site burden
